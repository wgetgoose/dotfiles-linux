# Dotfiles
A set of dotfiles for NeoVim, ZSH, Alacritty, and the like managed using [chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi). `chezmoi` is the reason that the files are named `dot_zshrc` instead of `.zshrc`. Designed for linux systems and tested on Fedora 39.

## NeoVim

Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) for easy plugin loading. I tried LazyVim and NVChad bundles, but they came with too many 
plugins which became overwhelming. Still a work in progress, so plugins aren't listed. 

## ZSH

[Antidote](https://github.com/mattmc3/antidote) for fast ZSH plugin management and ease. Super easy to add plugins through the `.zsh_plugins.txt` file and not really think twice. Currently using the [Pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) prompt and minimal other config through [zsh-utils](https://github.com/belak/zsh-utils) and [zsh-users](https://github.com/zsh-users) plugins.

## Alacritty

Just using the dracula theme as well as definining the JetBrainsMono font.
