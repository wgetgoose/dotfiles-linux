# Dotfiles
A set of dotfiles for NeoVim, ZSH, Alacritty, and the like managed using [chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi). Designed for linux systems and tested on Fedora 39.

## NeoVim

Using [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) because I don't want to manually manage a bunch of separate vim plugins and configurations. At some point I'll dive into lua and the whole nine, but not right now.

## ZSH

[Antidote](https://github.com/mattmc3/antidote) for fast ZSH plugin management and ease. Super easy to add plugins through the `.zsh_plugins.txt` file and not really think twice. Currently using the [Pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) prompt and minimal other config through [zsh-utils](https://github.com/belak/zsh-utils).

## Alacritty

Just using the dracula theme as well as definining the JetBrainsMono font.
